  <p>Go
I can in every way
Mistake the pain I feel inside
It comes to me
Evil thoughts just creeping through my mind
Who are you to say
That I can't speak what's on my mind?
It runs away
It's so predictable
I can in every way
Feel the stress that tangled up inside
Too blind to see
Emptiness and sorrow of their lives
They run away
To the cover of their pointless ties
You ask me
It's so predictable
I'm gonna try
But I'm gonna die
I'm gonna try
Another day
Silence overwhelms my mind
But who is to say
If I have the time or why?
Should I pray
For all the hate to go away?
Another day
I can never break free
You wait for me
I call out to you
Another day
I'll live forever
Why should I?
I'm gonna try
But I'm gonna die
I'm gonna try
fuck
I'm gonna try (should I?)
I'm gonna try (should I?)
I'm gonna try (should I?)
I'm gonna try, should I?
I'm gonna try
But I'm gonna die
I'm gonna try
